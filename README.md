# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The project is a prototype React web application utilising Tensorflow.js and the PoseNet model to estimate & compare human (yoga) poses.

The project is available publicly at the following url: [https://posenet-tensorflow-react.web.app/](https://posenet-tensorflow-react.web.app/).

## Instructions

Once the project is running in the browser:

1. Drag and drop or click the dropzone to select any image that contains a human (yoga) pose. Many images are avalable at [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/s/photos/yoga-pose).

2. On upload, the image will be analysed by PoseNet. The pose will be estimated and drawn over the uploaded image on screen.

3. Click 'Start Detection' to begin analysing your own pose through your webcam. Your pose will be fed to PoseNet, analysed and drawn onto the screen.

4. Try to copy the pose in the uploaded image as closely as possible. The more accurate you get, the more the progress bar will move to the right. Have fun!

## Future Updates

1. Bounding box to improve accuracy (coming next).

2. Need to keep a close eye on memory consumption.

3. Lots more!

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
